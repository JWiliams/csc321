# Code
The solution to homework 4 is divided up into two python files.
The first python file is graph.py. 
### graph.py
The outcome of graph.py will be
a list of domains used, a forward-DNS dictionary, a reverse-DNS 
dictionary.

The next file is called graph2.py
### graph2.py
The outcome of graph2.py will be domains linked to 
hostnames that were the result of their IP addresses 
being used in the python function "socket.getfdqn()"
